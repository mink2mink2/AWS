# AWS
Let's Learn AWS Auto ServerLess Skill!

[BASIC_FLUTTER_APP]
1. FYI, Basic Flutter APP is not Runnable.
2. I just fixed the code based on AWS Amplify tutorial with latest Dart Lib.
3. Original Tutorial Link : https://aws.amazon.com/ko/getting-started/hands-on/build-flutter-app-amplify/
4. When you try the code above link, you faced code error because of version changed.
5. Also, I removed auto generated Amplify folder in this repository, because I want to protect My Secure Data.
I wrote this code on 2022-03-11 with latest FLUTTER and DART

I hope this helpful for you.
